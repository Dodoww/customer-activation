This small extension makes it impossible for a customer to log in to magento, until the account has been activated in the adminhtml interface.

The Extension was designed to be used together with the [Netzarbeiter_LoginCatalog][] extension
Netzarbeiter_LoginCatalog only shows products to customers that are logged in.
There also is the Extension [Netzarbeiter_GroupsCatalog][] which may suit your needs better,
you have to evaluate yourself what is the best solution for your case.

This module can also be installed from [Magento Connect][mc].
