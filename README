Magento Module: Netzarbeiter/CustomerActivation
Author: Vinai Kopp <vinai@netzarbeiter.com>


USAGE

This small extension makes it impossible for a customer to log in to magento,
until the account has been activated in the adminhtml interface.

Customers > Manage Customers > (select customer) > Account Information > Is activated

The Extension was designed to be used together with the Netzarbeiter_LoginCatalog extension
Netzarbeiter_LoginCatalog only shows products to customers that are logged in.
There also is the Extension Netzarbeiter_GroupsCatalog which may suit your needs better,
you have to evaluate yourself what is the best solution for your case.

You can disable the Extension on a global or website level using the options found under
System > Configuration > Customer > Customer Activation

With the latest release this module now also works when customer email confirmation is turned
off.

Thanks to SeL for the french translation and the bugfix!
Thanks to SeL also for reporting the backend customer creation bug.

KNOWN BUGS:
