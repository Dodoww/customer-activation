Magento Module: Netzarbeiter/CustomerActivation
Author: Vinai Kopp <vinai@netzarbeiter.com>


USAGE

This small extension makes it impossible for a customer to log in to magento,
until the account has been activated in the adminhtml interface.

Customers > Manage Customers > (select customer) > Account Information > Is activated

The Extension was designed to be used together with the Netzarbeiter_LoginCatalog extension.
Netzarbeiter_LoginCatalog only shows products to customers that are logged in.


TODO:
- Make it possible to only use the feature for specific websites/stores (low priority)

KNOWN BUGS:
- Works only with email activation for new customers turned ON

If you have ideas for improvements or find bugs, please send them to vinai@netzarbeiter.com,
with Netzarbeiter_CustomerActivation as part of the subject line.
